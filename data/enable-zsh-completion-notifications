# Some shells (e.g. BASH) lack the post-execution hook,
# so we insert a callback into their pre-prompt hook instead.
# This results in a bogus callback on first prompt, which has to be ignored.
# I've tried some clever focus-based suppression but it was prone to race conditions.
# The only reliable way to work that around that we've found
# is always ignoring the first callback in each tab on the terminal side
# and deliberately issuing a fake callback from shells with a proper
# post-execution hook, such zsh and fish.
